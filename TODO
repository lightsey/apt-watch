Stuff to do before 1.0

  - Better FAM usage: don't start reloading the cache/downloading just
    because an atime changed.

  - In fact, never do either of these while a global apt program is running.

  - ssh tunneling

  - Finish the README.

  - Get some better icons to display the current status.

  - At least don't run an auto-update or auto-upgrade while a sub-package-manager is running.

  - Deal better with user actions during an update/etc.
